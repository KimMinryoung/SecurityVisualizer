# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Goal



## Development Documentation

Always consult `temp_dev/plan.md` before starting new work to understand the current phase and what comes next. Update these documents as phases are completed, and add new items when you plan further.

If you made a mistake, write it in temp_dev/mistakes.md, and try not to make that mistake again.

## Project Overview

1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Transform tasks into verifiable goals.


## Environment
- You are run in Windows 10.

## Caution
- When running bash commands on Windows, use /dev/null for output redirection, not nul.
